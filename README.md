# Data Scratchpad

Occasionally I might add some simple scripts about popular data science concepts and techniques here. The code samples
are basic implementations for learning purposes - they may be messy, unreliable or outdated.

Contents:

- **K-Means clustering** algorithm from scratch
- **Linear regression** implemented from scratch
- **Gaussian Elimination** for Linear Equations
- **LU decomposition** from scratch
- **Chebyshev** Inequality for Poisson, Binomial and Normal distribution
- **Captcha Solver**: A fastai model trained to solve captcha images from my university portal. Model weights are not
  included to prevent misuse.
- **RC Entrance Task**: RC internship entrance was a fraud detection task on an employment website dataset. I
  experimented with `keras` and `fastai` neural nets for this task (once again!).
